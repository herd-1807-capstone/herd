Hello, I am Patrick. With Mina, Andy and Pend, we are happy to present you Herd, an interactive tool we built for sharing 
location and information between a tour guide and the tour members.
It helps the guide with organizing a tour and a real time view of each member's location. Each participant can also where their guide is located, the spots to visit and important information on those spots.
A tour member starts by logging in with an email and password or a Google accont through Firebase Auth, which we selected for its convenience and security.
Mina will now show you how the guided visit unfolds.
