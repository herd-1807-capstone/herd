Hello, I am Patrick. Tell me, have you ever been lost in a foreign place, and desperately looking for your group?
With Mina, Andy and Peng, we are happy to present you Herd, an interactive tool we built for sharing 
location and information between a tour guide and the tour members, and kinda save the day.
It helps the guide with organizing a tour and a real time view of each member's location. Each participant can also see where their guide is located, the spots to visit and important information on those spots.
A tour member starts by logging in with an email and password or a Google account through Firebase Auth, which we selected for its convenience and security.
Mina will now show you how the guided visit unfolds.
