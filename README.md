### Summary

HERD is a web-based app built as an interactive tool for tour guides and tour members.
It is an platform-agnostic app for sharing location and information in real time.
Tour guides can build and modify organized tours and track each tour member's location. Each participant can see at all times where their tour guide is located, the spots part of the visit and important
information on those spots.

Other features include tour selection, communication between each person part of the group, a general broadcast, a tour preview and a heat map for valuable feedback.
